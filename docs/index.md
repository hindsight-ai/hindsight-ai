# Documentation Index

A quick reference to the key documents that describe Hindsight AI's architecture, operations, and product workflows.

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — Deep dive into the distributed architecture: dashboard SPA, FastAPI service, worker fleet, data stores, message queues, and the ingress layer. Highlights deployment topologies, traffic flow, and cross-service security contracts so engineers can reason about latency, availability, and scale. Includes diagrams and callouts for shared infrastructure such as Redis, Celery, and Postgres.
- [authentication_flow.md](authentication_flow.md) — Explains how Cloudflare, Traefik, oauth2-proxy, and Google OAuth collaborate to authenticate users, then walks through beta access gating, redirect logic, and admin review tokens. Useful for debugging login loops, CORS failures, or mixed-content issues. Documents the status state machine and idempotent approval workflow introduced for beta invitations.
- [data-governance-orgs-users.md](data-governance-orgs-users.md) — Covers data residency, retention, and access control models for organisations, workspaces, and end users. Details how PII flows through ingestion pipelines, the anonymisation policies applied in analytics, and how deletions propagate. Includes compliance considerations for GDPR and SOC2 audits.
- [debug-panel-requirements.md](debug-panel-requirements.md) — Specifies the internal troubleshooting surface: required metrics, feature flags, impersonation safeguards, and audit logging expectations. Describes UX affordances for support engineers, including search filters, pagination, and role-based restrictions. Anchors acceptance tests for the debug console.
- [HINDSIGHT_FIXES_RESUME.md](HINDSIGHT_FIXES_RESUME.md) — Summarises the backlog triage performed when development resumed: bugs addressed, regression tests added, and outstanding risks. Provides context for why certain fixes were prioritised, links to tickets, and describes customer-facing impact. Good historical reference for QA and release notes.
- [implementation-progress-and-plan.md](implementation-progress-and-plan.md) — Rolling status document outlining milestones, blockers, and next actions across major epics. Includes burndown narratives, dependency callouts, and ownership assignments. Helps leadership and ICs track delivery of initiatives like beta access, notification overhaul, or token UI rebuild.
- [organization-management-requirements.md](organization-management-requirements.md) — Defines user stories for organisation CRUD, membership invitations, role transitions, and billing hooks. Captures edge cases such as orphaned organisations, domain claiming, and conflict resolution. Drives backend schema design and front-end form behaviour for org administration.
- [requirements.md](requirements.md) — Master specification for Hindsight AI encompassing product goals, functional requirements, non-functional constraints, and success metrics. Sections cover search, summarisation, notifications, integrations, and governance. Serves as the baseline document for scope reviews and change-control.
- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) — Quarterly roadmap articulating strategic themes, release trains, and capacity allocations. Outlines success criteria, earliest delivery dates, and decision checkpoints for go/no-go reviews. Integrates signals from sales, customer success, and engineering OKRs.
- [traefik_troubleshooting.md](traefik_troubleshooting.md) — Incident playbook for diagnosing routing, TLS, or middleware problems in Traefik. Enumerates common log signatures, curl probes, certificate renewal steps, and fallback procedures. Essential for resolving 502/504 spikes, OAuth callback issues, or misrouted subdomains.
- [adr/](adr/) — Collection of architectural decision records documenting context, alternatives, pros/cons, and final recommendations. Allows contributors to track why choices like oauth2-proxy, PostgreSQL schemas, or queue semantics were adopted. Vital for onboarding new engineers and avoiding repeated debates.

Additional plans and governance notes produced during recent initiatives:

- [NOTIFICATION-PLAN.md](../NOTIFICATION-PLAN.md) — Lays out the notification architecture upgrade: channel mix, event taxonomy, delivery SLAs, and compliance constraints. Identifies stakeholder expectations, sequencing of email/SMS/push work, and dependency on transactional providers. Acts as a charter for the notification squad.
- [NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_PROGRESS.md](../NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_PROGRESS.md) — Time-ordered log of notification system development, documenting completed milestones, retro learnings, and outstanding actions. Used for weekly status reporting and cross-team visibility. Captures metrics like delivery latency, bounce rates, and template coverage.
- [PAT_REVISION_PLAN.md](../PAT_REVISION_PLAN.md) — Outlines the redesign of the Process Automation Toolkit: scope boundaries, phased rollout, and migration strategy. Highlights technical debt to retire, UX gaps to address, and success metrics. Guides coordination between backend automation pipelines and UI shell rebuilds.
- [TASK_PLAN.md](../TASK_PLAN.md) — Canonical tracker of tasks spanning engineering, design, QA, and ops. Breaks work into actionable tickets with owners, estimates, blockers, and dependencies. Useful for sprint ceremonies, daily standups, and ensuring cross-functional alignment.
- [TEST-COVERAGE-PLAN.md](../TEST-COVERAGE-PLAN.md) — Defines objectives for raising automated test coverage: target percentages by layer, critical paths to protect, and tooling investments. Includes phased backlog for unit, integration, contract, and E2E suites. Helps teams justify time spent on test debt.
- [TOKEN_UI_PROPOSAL.md](../TOKEN_UI_PROPOSAL.md) — Presents the design proposal for token management: UX flows, permission model, API contracts, and visual mockups. Discusses audit requirements, rotation policies, and integration with backend token issuance. Sets expectations before implementation kicks off.
- [BETA_ACCESS_PLAN.md](../BETA_ACCESS_PLAN.md) — Documents strategy for beta programme management: eligibility criteria, review SLA, communication cadence, and analytics. Details alignment with product marketing, support readiness, and risk mitigation. Complements the authentication flow doc with operational context.

> Tip: Keep this index updated whenever a new document is added so contributors can discover the latest sources of truth quickly.
