- [x] Defined acceptance criteria (AC-NOTIF-1 through AC-NOTIF-8)
- [x] Created XML status tracking system
- [x] Documented database schema and technical architecture

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

- [x] **Task 1.6:** Create basic notification API endpoints

### âœ… Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (COMPLETED)
**Status:** All tasks completed (8/8)
**Timeline:** September 11, 2025

#### Completed Tasks:
1. âœ… **NotificationContext Creation** - Created comprehensive React Context with state management
2. âœ… **API Service Layer** - Built notificationApiService.ts with full CRUD operations  
3. âœ… **NotificationBell Component** - Header bell icon with unread count badge
4. âœ… **NotificationDropdown Component** - Interactive notification list with mark as read
5. âœ… **NotificationSettingsModal** - User preferences management interface
6. âœ… **Component Styling** - Consistent Tailwind CSS styling matching dashboard design
7. âœ… **Backend Integration** - Connected to notification API endpoints with auth
8. âœ… **App Layout Integration** - Added NotificationProvider and NotificationBell to MainContent header

#### Integration Details:
- **Context Hierarchy:** AuthProvider â†’ NotificationProvider â†’ OrganizationProvider â†’ OrgProvider
- **Header Layout:** NotificationBell positioned in top-right corner near UserAccountButton following standard UX conventions
- **UX Positioning:** Moved notification bell from left to right side based on user feedback - users expect notifications in top-right area
- **Real-time Updates:** Polling every 30 seconds for new notifications
- **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile and desktop with proper spacing

#### UX Positioning Update (September 11, 2025):
Following user feedback and standard UX conventions, the notification bell was repositioned from the left header area to the top-right corner near the user account button. This aligns with user expectations as most applications place notification controls in the top-right area where users naturally look for them.

4. **Integration**: Organization invitations automatically create notifications
5. **User Preferences**: Granular control over notification types
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout

### Ready for Next Phase:
- âœ… **Phase 2**: Frontend UI components can now be built
